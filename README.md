# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

This project aims to build a classification model to detect credit card fraud based on transaction data. The model is trained on a dataset containing features extracted from credit card transactions, such as transaction amount, time, and various anonymized numerical features. The goal is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions and minimize false positives and false negatives.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset. It contains a large number of credit card transactions, including both fraudulent and legitimate transactions. The dataset is imbalanced, with a small percentage of fraudulent transactions compared to legitimate ones. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several sections:

1. Data Exploration: In this section, the dataset is loaded, and basic exploratory analysis is performed to understand the structure and distribution of the data.

2. Data Preprocessing: This section focuses on preparing the data for model training. It includes steps such as handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and addressing class imbalance if necessary.

3. Model Building: Here, a classification model is selected and trained on the preprocessed data. Various algorithms can be used, such as logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, or neural network.

4. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and average precision. The evaluation helps assess the performance and effectiveness of the classification model.

5. Conclusion: This section provides a summary of the project, key findings, and potential future improvements. It reflects on the model's performance and its implications for credit card fraud detection.
